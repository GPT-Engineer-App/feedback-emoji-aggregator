# feedback-emoji-aggregator

I want an app where users can:

- Create new demo, with a headline
- Click on a demo, and see aggregate of emoji reactions to that demo, and a list of feedback to the demo
- click emojis on the demo, which will write to database with the emoji reaction record
- write feedback, which will write to database
